## Install Instructions

This application requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run, so ensure Node.js is installed first.  

To get started, ensure the following files and folders are present in the root directory:

* ```index.js``` (to initialize the application and write the README file)
* ```package.json``` (contains dependencies)
* ```/utils``` folder containing ```generateMarkdown.js``` (to generate markdown)

Then, open an integrated or bash terminal and run the following command to install [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer):

    npm i  

Once installed, confirm the folder ```/node_modules/inquirer``` is present before proceeding to Usage Instructions.
 
## Usage Instructions

Open an integrated terminal or bash command prompt and type the following command, then press enter: 

    node index.js

Follow the prompts and respond as desired to populate your readme.  

After the last response is given, the README(.md) file will be automatically generated in the root directory.  

If using VScode, right-click on the README file and select 'Open Preview' to see your presentable README.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributors are welcome. Just remember, this is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

## Test Instructions
